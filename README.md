# [Cyclistic_Bike_Sharing_Analysis]
This is the first use case I performed as a data analysts.
"Cyclistic" (a made-up entrprise) has identified that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. 
To support future growth, the goal of this analysis is to understand the differences in bike usage between the two groups and, based on this, design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
